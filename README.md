hi! my name is michael, i'm a software engineer currently working at <biotech corp> building tooling and infrastructure supporting secondary bioinformatics analysis

while my experience leans towards ml applications in genomics and clinical text, i'm very excited by ml infra and i want to lean more into learning about distributed training as well as cv applications in video gen

take a look at my fun side projects here!
